# Predicting Arrhythmias: A Big Data Project ðŸ«€

Cardiac arrhythmias are a major health problem that can cause heart failure, stroke, and even death. Early detection of arrhythmias is essential to improve patient prognosis.

In this project, we propose to develop an autoencoder model to detect anomalous electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Autoencoders are a class of neural networks that can learn to represent data efficiently. In this case, the autoencoder would learn to represent both normal and anomalous ECG signals.

To do this, we have developed a small application to see how the project could be applied in practice.
